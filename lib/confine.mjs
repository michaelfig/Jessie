 * <li>The faux <tt>confineExpr</tt> does not have a third
 *     <tt>opt_options</tt> parameter. An options argument can of
 *     course be provided by the caller, but it will be ignored.
 * <li>The expression can be in the subset of ES6 supported by
 *     Babel.
 * <li>All dangerous globals that are not shadowed, such as "window"
 *     or "document", are still accessible by the evaled expression.
 * <li>The current binding of these properties at the time that
 *     <tt>confineExpr</tt> is called are used as the initial
 *     bindings. Further changes to either the properties or the
 *     bindings are not tracked by the other.
 * <li>In the evaled expression, <tt>this</tt> is bound to
